// Inheritance.
// Access specifier are the access restictions imposed during
// the derivation of differnt subclasses from the base class.
// --> There are 3 types of access specifiers. They are:

/*
    1) private mode:
        Every thing from base class except the private section's
        data/functions are derived into the private section of
        derived class.
    2) protected mode:
        Everything from base class except the private section's
        data/functions are derived into the protected section of
        derived class.
    3) public mode:
        Everything from base class except the private section's
        data/functions are derived into the same section as they
        are in the base class. meaning, the protected data member
        of base class will be inside the protected section of
        derived class, and public members of base class will be
        in public section of derived class.
