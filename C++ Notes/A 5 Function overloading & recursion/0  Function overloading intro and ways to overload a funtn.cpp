A feature of OOP where 2 or more functions can have 
same name but different parameters is called function 
overloading or function polymorphism.
To overload a function with same name, the function must
obey any one of the following conditions.
    1. Parameters should have different type.
    2. parameters numbers should be different.
    3. Parameters should have different sequence.
